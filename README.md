# Bagek's Equiney Add-On
Bagek's add-on mod is a mod that brings new blocks, items for people who want more equestrian things. This mod also adds new variants of the SWEM tack without replacing any of the original tack.

***Please note this mod is only early in development and has many things to come***

### ***About The Mod***
Bagek's Equiney Add-On *{BEAOM}* is a mod that is both an addon and its own mod. It brings more variety of new tack for SWEM horses. 

*All* tack and *most* items/blocks in this mod will be eventually crafted using either Sunburst, Equium or Coralarite, which can be found in caves, creative mode or loot chests.
All items/blocks will eventually be able to be crafted and available to view in JEI.

Besides the new tack the equiney add-on will bring new items/blocks like;

♞ different tack sets
♞ plenty of different colours
♞ a bunch of different types of tack
♞ and more

This mod will be created for 1.18.2 and 1.20. There are no plans *as of now* to bring it to 1.16.

All these new models I made myself (unless specified in CREDITS).

### Thankyou to our helpers for putting time into this mod alongside myself.
